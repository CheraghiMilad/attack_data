# Attack Data Repository üß±
A Repository of curated datasets from various attacks to:

* Easily develop detections without having to build an environment from scratch or simulate an attack.
* Test detections, specifically [Splunks Security Content](https://github.com/splunk/security-content)
* Replay/inject into streaming pipelines for validating your detections in your production SIEM

# Installation
GitHub LFS is used in this project. Here is a [tutorial](https://git-lfs.github.com/) how to install and use it.

# Anatomy of a Dataset üß¨
### Datasets
Datasets are defined by a common yml structure. The structure has the following fields:

|field| description|
|---|---|
|name  | name of author  |
| date  | last modified date  |
| dataset  | array of urls where the hosted version of the dataset is located  |
| description | describes the dataset as detailed as possible |
| environment |  markdown filename of the environment description see below |
| technique | array of MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with dataset |
| references | array of urls that reference the dataset |
| sourcetypes | array of sourcetypes that are contained in the dataset |


For example

### Environments

Environments are a description of where the dataset was collected. At this moment there are no specific restrictions, although we do have a simple [template](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/blob/master/environments/TEMPLATE.md) a user can start with here. The most common environment for most datasets will be the [attack_range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/blob/master/environments/attack_range.md) since this is the tool that used to generate attack data sets automatically.

# Ingest Datasets üçΩ
Most datasets generated will be raw log files. There are two main simple ways to ingest it.

### Into Splunk

0. Download dataset
1. In splunk enterprise , add data -> Files & Directories -> select dataset
2. Set the sourcetype as specified in the yml file
3. Explore your data

See a quick demo üì∫ of this process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41NAG0zGg40).

### Into DSP

To send datasets into DSP the simplest way is to use the [scloud](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DSP/1.1.0/Admin/AuthenticatewithSCloud) command-line-tool as a requirement.

1. Download the dataset
2. Ingest the dataset into DSP via scloud command `cat attack_data.json | scloud ingest post-events --format json`
3. Build a pipeline that reads from firehose and you should see the events.

# Contribute Datasets ü•∞

1. Generate a dataset
2. Upload dataset into same folder
3. Make PR with dataset <name>.yml file under the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK technique folder.

Note the simplest way to generate a dataset to contribute is to launch your simulations in the attack_range, or manually attack the machines and when done dump the data using the [dump function](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#dump-log-data-from-attack-range).

See a quick demo üì∫ of the process to dump a dataset [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnD0BtjCILs).

To contribute a dataset simply create a PR on this repository, for general instructions on creating a PR [see this guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

# Automatically generated Datasets ‚öôÔ∏è

This project takes advantage of automation to generate datasets using the attack_range. You can see details about this service on this [sub-project folder attack_data_service](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/tree/master/attack_data_service).
