# Attack Data Repository üß±
A Repository of curated datasets from various attacks to:

* Easily develop detections without having to build an environment from scratch or simulate an attack.
* Test detections, specifically [Splunks Security Content](https://github.com/splunk/security-content)
* Replay/inject into streaming pipelines for validating your detections in your production SIEM 

# Anatomy of a Dataset üß¨
### Datasets
datasets are defined by a common yml structure the structure has the following fields:

|field| description|
|---|---|
|name  | name of author  |
| date  | last odified date  |
| dataset  | array of urls where the hosted version of the dataset is located  |
| description | describes the dataset as detailed as possible |
| environment |  markdown filename of the environment description see below |
| technique | array of MITRE ATT&CK techniques associated with dataset | 
| references | array of urls that references the dataset |
| sourcetypes | array of sourcetypes that are contained in the dataset | 


For example	

```
author: Patrick Bareiss
date: '2020-10-08'
description: 'Atomic Test Results: Successful Execution of test T1003.002-1 Registry
  dump of SAM, creds, and secrets Return value unclear for test T1003.002-2 Registry
  parse with pypykatz Successful Execution of test T1003.002-3 esentutl.exe SAM copy '
environment: attack_range
technique:
- T1003.002
dataset:
- https://attack-range-attack-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/T1003.002/attack-range-windows-domain-controller.json
- https://attack-range-attack-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/T1003.002/windows-powershell.log
- https://attack-range-attack-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/T1003.002/windows-security.log
- https://attack-range-attack-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/T1003.002/windows-security_ssa.log
- https://attack-range-attack-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/T1003.002/windows-sysmon.log
- https://attack-range-attack-data.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/T1003.002/windows-system.log

  - https://github.com/splunk/security-content/blob/develop/tests/T1003_002.yml
sourcetypes: 
  - XmlWinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
  - WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational
  - WinEventLog:System
  - WinEventLog:Security
```

typically datasets generated by the attack_range dump features will start with a folder name of the MITRE ATT&CK technique, and seen by the default filename: `dataset.yml` otherwise a custom folder and file name can be used. 

### Environments

Environments are a description of where the dataset was collected. At this moment there are no specific restrictions, although we do have a simple [template](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/blob/master/environments/TEMPLATE.md) a user can start with here. The most common environment for most datasets will be the [attack_range](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/blob/master/environments/attack_range.md) since this is the tool that used to generate attack data sets automatically. 

# Ingest Datasets üçΩ
Most datasets generated will be of type JSON. There are two main simple ways to ingest it.

### Into Splunk

0. Download dataset 
1. In splunk enterprise , add data -> Files & Directories -> select dataset
2. Set the sourcetype to JSON
3. Set SHOULD_LINEMERGE to `false`
4.  Explore your data

See a quick demo üì∫ of this process [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41NAG0zGg40).

### Into DSP

To send datasets into DSP the simplest way is to use the [scloud](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/DSP/1.1.0/Admin/AuthenticatewithSCloud) command-line-tool as a requirement. 

1. Download the dataset
2. Ingest the dataset into DSP via scloud command `cat attack_data.json | scloud ingest post-events --format json`
3. Build a pipeline that reads from firehose and you should seeing the events. 

# Contribute Datasets ü•∞

1. Generate a dataset
2. Upload dataset to s3 bucket or similar hosting service
3. Make PR with dataset <name>.yml file under the corresponding MITRE ATT&CK technique folder.

Note the simplest way to generate a dataset to contribute is to launch your simulations in the attack_range, or manually attack the machines and when done dump the data using the [dump function](https://github.com/splunk/attack_range#dump-log-data-from-attack-range). 

See a quick demo üì∫ of the process to dump a dataset [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnD0BtjCILs).

To contribute a dataset simple create a PR on this repository, for general instructions on create a PR [see this guide](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962). 

# Automatically generated Datasets ‚öôÔ∏è

This project takes advantage of automation to generate datasets using the attack_range. You can see details about this service on this [sub-project folder attack_data_service](https://github.com/splunk/attack_data/tree/master/attack_data_service).
