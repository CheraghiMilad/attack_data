description: Dataset generated from AWS CloudTrail logs capturing the lifecycle of
  an intentionally exposed S3 bucket, including its creation, public access configuration
  (via bucket policy and website hosting), and subsequent deletion. This simulates
  the detection of potentially risky S3 bucket configurations and their decommissioning
  process.
