description: These datasets correspond to different risk_events for an Enterprise Security server that are generated from the Living Off The Land analytic story detections. The dataset have been adjusted to reflect risk events from user `fyodor@splunktshirtcompany.com` and machine `fyodor-l.splunktshirtcompany.com`. Since these are risk events the sourcetype is stash and the source is the name of each detection on the datasets.
